        One of the last questions asked at the end of the surveys were if they would switch to electrical cars, given the opportunity.

          <p>
            Around 60% of the popluation would switch to electrical cars if the opportunity were to be presented, however, most who would traveled shorter distances and therefore would reap the benefits.
            Surprisingly, the cost of fuel had no real correlation with those who would switch but related more to the fuel type since most used petrol to drive short distances.

          <h3>What benefits would be present of switching now?</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Since electrical cars arn't common on our roads, changing now would allow for much lower electrical costs compared to when multiple others join.
            Not only would the cost be lower at the moment, but the cost of a cheap electrical car would also be lower then the possible future.
            However, since its rare to see electrical cars, no fuel stations have areas to charge, meaning the car is only for short bursts of driving.
