            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">This study aims to find the most effective amount of exercise in increasing concentration levels. This is relevant for people of all ages as people normally need to concentrate for their jobs. The target of this study was the people of Victoria, representing the Australian population, both males and females and focus mainly on the amount of exercised for people to have the same exercise levels, per age. </p>

            <h2>Constraints</h2>
            <ul class="lead mb-0">
              <li><strong>The ability to measure concentration levels:</strong> A major part of this survey is measuring concentration levels. People might not answer the test questions properly or might not be 100% honest with their responses about themselves.</li>
              <li><strong>Measuring amount of exercise:</strong> In the survey, the participants are required to input the amount of exercise they do per week. Some participants might not answer this correctly, therefore skewering results.</li>
              <li><strong>Time:</strong> The amount of time I have to collect my results may limit how people respond as some people may do more exercise in summer or winter as that is when their primary sport is.</li>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">A survey was used as a major part of my data collection. The survey was made using google forms allowing responses to be automatically saved to a spread sheet which was also saved to cloud storage.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row no-gutters">

            <h4>Data Sources</h4>
            <p class="lead mb-0">The primary data collected was collected via google forms, allowing for the data to be automatically saved to a google spreadsheet for easy data collation. By having a survey in the form of a google form, it allows for multiple users to fill it out all at the same time, at a time which is convenient for them. It also means that users wonâ€™t be pressured to answer questions in a certain way and allows responses to remain anonymous. The form was aimed at people of all ages and genders, allowing everyone to fill out the survey.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">The interviews were conducted in person and data was record or recorded for further analysis. This allowed for collection of qualitative data about how people felt exercise affected their concentration. The interviews incorporated people from a range of ages for a broad range of responses.</p>

            <h2>Data Manipulation</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">A spreadsheet was used to analyse my data and group it into different categories. I used google sheets as it allowed me to begin data analysis while the survey was still collecting responses as they would automatically be saved to the file.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row no-gutters">
          <div class="col-lg-12 order-lg-1 my-auto showcase-text">
            <h4>Survey</h4>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Surveys were first analysed for unrealistic responses such as inexistent occupations or impossible amounts of exercise per week, such as one respondent who imputed more hours per week of exercise than there is hours in a week. These responses were deleted, as it is not known how much of the rest of the data is also invalid.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Responses were then codified and categorised depending on age, amount of exercise and results of the multiple tests used to analyse concentration. The frequency of responses and percentages of certain questions were then also found and analysed. The mean of the results were also calculated and used for analysis. Results were graphed so that patterns could additionally be visualised.</p>

            <h4>Interviews and other qualitative data</h4>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Responses were codified and categorised into different group based on common responses to the questions. These responses were more based on their thinking behind the research topic rather than testing their individual concentration levels.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">These results were codified and grouped so that a frequency of results could also be analysed. The individual responses were then analysed in detail so that the actual information could be written up and personal opinions could be used to help support my hypothesis or not.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead mb-0">The articles and websites found throughout secondary research supported both components of my hypothesis. Common themes throughout the articles and websites were organised into a document for further analysis. Common themes from my data collection and the secondary research were noted in that document, if there was any.</p>
