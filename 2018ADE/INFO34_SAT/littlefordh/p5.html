        <p>Boomerang bags are free, and they lead to greater than 62,000 kilograms of waste being diverting from landfill.
          It was found that between 6,350 and 245,000 metric tons of plastic is estimated to float on the ocean's surface.
          Therefore	by using Boomerang Bags you can help to reduce this figure and help save the environment and the animals being harmed.

      <p><strong>The survey showed there is a clear correlation that awareness, reward
        and punishment would lead to a reduction in rubbish. It also showed
        that people are not looking for solutions and are often not recognizing the extent of the issue but may be willing to implement
        changes to reduce their rubbish if it was organized for them, if they were given
        a reward or were punished.  Therefore, the hypothesis is partly
        correct as it shows those surveyed are willing to reduce their rubbish
        however, it is not all about reward as other factors motivate people.
