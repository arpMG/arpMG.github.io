    Face to face surveys conducted on a range of test subjects ranging from primary aged to octogenarian that aimed on collecting more in depth data.
    Here the limits of short term memory were pushed in a variety of tests that focused on participants' ability to remember, numbers, words, pictures, colours and sounds.
    A large portion of this was done with thanks to the help of my year 12 informatics class who collected data with me on about 30 year 2 students.

    I interviewed a psychologist on the workings of short memory and factors that affect our short term memory. This helped guide my research bolstered data I collected manually or from the Google Form.
