      <img class="toddler" src="images/toddler_burned.jpg" alt="young age group">
        <span class="showDisplayOnHover">
          Young age group (6-15)
          <span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
            The younger participants struggled most with the numbers and excelled with the pattern matching.
            This could be down to familiarity of patterns and shapes for primary aged children.

    <a class="hideDisplay">
      <img class="teenager" src="images/teenager_burned.jpg" alt="middle age group">
      <span class="showDisplayOnHover">
        Middle age group (15-35)
        <span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
          The middle aged respondants achieved the best results out of the three age categories,
          only being matched by the younger participants in the pattern tests.

    <a class="hideDisplay">
      <img class="old" src="images/old.png" alt="old age group">
      <span class="showDisplayOnHover">
        Older age group (over 35)
        <span class="showBodyOfDisplayOnHover">
          The over 35 category didn't perform as well as the middle group but still out-performed the younger ones in all three categories.
          This could be down to more experience dealing with the large words and numbers that were challenging for 6-8 year olds.

    <h3 class="sub2">Other conclusions</h3>
    It appeared in my research that people were better at remembering patterns rather than words and especially numbers.
    No reseach I found can back this up and it could be put down to the difficulty of the test. <br><br>
    Another interesting discovery was that women performed better than men in genral in the tests.
    This was most evident in the middle age category. A possible reason for this could be that women have been shown to have better attention spans than men, especially in this age demograpic.

    <h3 class="sub2">additional notes</h3>
    While the data collected did support my hypothesis and secondary research, the results are far from conclusive.
    The scale of the project was fairly small and it would be inaccurate to say that all surveys were conducted under identical conditions.
    Meausures were in place to keep data integral such trying to replicate each test sat by a participant as much as possible.<br><br>
