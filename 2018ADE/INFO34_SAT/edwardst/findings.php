    <h3 class="sub">How short term memory works</h3>
        The expert interview conducted stated that our memory works like someone’s ability to write down words on paper. We all have different handwriting, much like we all remember things differently and we all can write and different speeds and proficiency much like peoples ability to remember inputs. Much of the workings of our memory is still unknown as our brain is unbelievably complex.
        <br>Factors that affect out memory are:<br>
        •	Aging <br>
        •	Plaque in the brain – dead neurons that stop messages being passed to each other<br>
        •	Drug and alcohol abuse<br>
        •	Stress and overall trauma.<br>
        A common technique to improve our short-term memory is an associative technique such as picturing yourself walking down a street your familiar with and each house being a different object you want to remember. A good example of this is Sherlock Holmes’ mind palace where each room in a virtual palace is a different section of memory for him.

  <h3 class="sub">What I found is that...</h3>
  My research was broken down into numbers pictures and words.
  I wanted to not only find the correlation between ages but also between different sensory inputs,
  for example if people are better at remembering words than numbers.
  The chart on the left gives details some of the findings I made and the graph below shows the scores of all participants in my research.
