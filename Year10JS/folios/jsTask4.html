            <h2>Task 4 - Using Functions with parameters</h2>
            <p>A <em>function</em> is a small sub-program which performs a specific task and can return the result of some processing to the main program</p>
            <p>A parameter is a <em>variable</em> that is passed into a function. The value that is passed is used inside the function to complete its task.</p>

            <h3>Activity - Simple Parameter Activities</h3>
            <p>Create a page that has the following.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>function</strong> called <span class="codeSnip">sum()</span> which takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of those two numbers to the calling function.</li>
                <li>A <strong>function</strong> called <span class="codeSnip">diff()</span> which takes two numbers as parameters and returns the difference between them (as a positive number) to the calling function.</li>
                <li>A <strong>function</strong> called <span class="codeSnip">in_out()</span> which collects user input, passes these to the <span class="codeSnip">sum()</span> and <span class="codeSnip">diff()</span> functions, then outputs the results to
                    the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>Ensure you have the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>A separate folder for your JS folio work</li>
                    <li>An images folder - make sure you rename any borrowed images to useful filenames</li>
                    <li>A lot of fun</li>
