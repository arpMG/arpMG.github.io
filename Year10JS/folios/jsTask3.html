            <ol>
                <li>Asks the user for their age in years and tells them if they are old enough to get their Learner's Permit or not.</li>
                <li>Asks the user for a character and tells them if it is a vowell or a consonant or neither.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Extension: Have the use enter their date of birth and calculate their age from that, then tell them if (or when) they can get their Learner's.<br>You can find information about dates and date calculations <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp">here</a></p>

                <li>An images folder - make sure you rename any borrowed images to useful filenames</li>
